Android SDK Samples Search
==========================

A simple Google Chrome Extension which adds a 'sample code' link to Android API class reference pages to help you find relevant code examples within the official Android SDK sample code projects.

Uses GitHub search and the AOSP platform_development package mirror hosted there.
